// Question 78: Function Expressions vs. Function Declarations: Compare function expressions and declarations by creating one of each that performs the same task, such as squaring a number.

// Function Expressions
function square(num: number): number {
  return num * num;
}

// Function Declarations
let squareExpression = function (num: number): number {
  return num * num;
}
