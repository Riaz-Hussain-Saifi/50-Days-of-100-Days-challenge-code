Object.defineProperty(exports, "__esModule", { value: true });
// Answer: Breakpoints are a powerful tool for debugging JavaScript code. They allow to pause the execution of our code at a specific point and examine.
// The state of the program at that moment. To use breakpoints in browser developer tools, follow these steps:
// 1. Open the developer tools of browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).
// 2. Navigate to the "Sources" tab.
// 3. Locate the file containing the JavaScript code as want to debug.
// 4. Click on the line number where want to set a breakpoint.
// 5. The line number will turn blue, indicating that a breakpoint has been set.
// 6. Run code and the execution will pause at the breakpoint.
