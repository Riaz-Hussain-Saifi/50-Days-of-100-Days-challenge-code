// Question 75: Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using compound operators.

let x = 4;
x += 5; // x = 9
x -= 3; // x = 6
x *= 2; // x = 12
x /= 2; // x = 6
